PSSH is a really greate open source project which helps me a lot with my
distribute workds. You can find the instruction below in Parallel-ssh's google
code page:

PSSH provides parallel versions of OpenSSH and related tools. Included are pssh,
pscp, prsync, pnuke, and pslurp. The project includes psshlib which can be used
within custom applications. The source code is written in Python and can be cloned
from: git clone git://aml.cs.byu.edu/pssh.git

Now I modified this project, removed some parts and that makes this Insecure-pssh.
In this version, you can write password in your hosts.txt, it is useful when your 
servers are not set with only one password. But it is not safe to use. 
This version only contains pssh, pscp and pslurp. I've test these codes in Arch Linux
and Centos 5.5 with python 2.7. Please report bugs or help me to improve this insecure
one.
Remember! It is INSECURE! You must take RISK by yourself!
